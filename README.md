# TODO

- [x] Keep a track of number of times a word was revised
- ~~~[x] Number of tries it took to revise the word~~~ Dropped the idea 
- [ ] Capitalise the word which is being revised during the sentence revision
- [x] Show the meaning of the word as well during the sentence revision
- [ ] Maybe a bug while adding new words to the CSV. Adds " to the file automatically
